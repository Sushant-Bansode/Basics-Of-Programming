//Implement Union 

/*Unions can be useful in many situations where we want to use the 
same memory for two or more members. 
Now suppose we want to implement a binary tree data structure
where each leaf node has a double data value,
while each internal node has pointers to two children, but no data.

Your have to create Binary Tree struct node. 
In the Binary Tree you should have members with one 
as double data and the other as union containing left and right pointers.

Your Task:
You just have to create struct binary tree node wih required data members.
