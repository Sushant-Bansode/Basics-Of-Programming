// STRUCTURE AREA

/*As now you have learnt about how to create structures. 
Let us now see how to assign values to data members of structures
and perform some operation.

Given a structure area with side,
le and wd as data members. 
Your task is to assign values to data members and
find area of square with side side and area of 
rectangle with length le and width wd. 
You will be given a function find_areas(side, le, wd) 
which side, le and wd as an argument.

Example 1:

Input:
side = 25
le = 40
wd = 60
Output: 
625 2400
Explanation:
Area of square with given side 25 is:
625(side*side) and area of rectangle is:
2400(len*wid).

Your Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, 
you just have to complete the function find_areas().
