// ADD TWO COMPLEX NUMBERS

/*In this problem, you need to add 2 given complex numbers
and return the resulting complex number to the function add().

A struct named Complex containing data members as real and 
imaginary part of the complex number is implemented already.

Example 1:
Input:
c1 = 3+6i 
c2 = -1+4i
Output:
2 + 10i

Your Task:
Just complete the given function add() having 
two Complex structs as arguments. Return the new 
Complex struct to the function. Don't print anything.
